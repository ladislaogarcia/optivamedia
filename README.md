# Simple Graphic Cards Application



This is a technical challenge developed with NodeJS and Angular.

It is divided into two pieces: server and client.
<br>
<br>
## Server
This is an application developed only with NodeJS using the 'http' module to create a simple JSON server. Simple to manage, too.

- NodeJS **'http'** module: https://nodejs.org/api/http.html
<br>
<br>
## Client
This is an application developed under Angular framework.

- ***RxJS*** is used for manage the asynchronous behaviours: https://rxjs.dev/
- ***NgRx*** is used for manage the application state: https://ngrx.io/
